# Thesis Template

A LaTeX template and some utilities for your Bachelor/Master thesis.
The template is specialized for Cognitive Science at Osnabrück University, but could easily be adapted.

## Usage

Click `Use this template` on the upper right and create your own working copy of the repository.
Clone and work with your own repository instead of this one.
Finally, give your supervisor access to the newly created repository under `Settings > Collaborators`.

## Installation

To use this template you first of all need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Using Devcontainer

If you have docker on your machine, you can easily write your thesis inside a container
that has all the necessary software already installed.
Install the [Remove Development Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
for VSCode. Then type <kbd>F1</kbd> > `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
A new instance of VSCode should open. Open `thesis.txt` and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>
to build the latex document.

### Using Native Installation

First you will need to install LaTeX. Assuming that your machine is running an Ubuntu based distro run in your terminal

    sudo apt install texlive-full biber

If you are on a different distro or operating system you will need to install LaTeX in a different way.

Install the following extensions into VSCode to enable processing of LaTeX documents and spell checking

    James-Yu.latex-workshop
    tecosaur.latex-utilities
    streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker

## General Guidelines

* Use American English. Cognitive Science is a discipline originating from the States. Also most research papers are written in American English.
* Use Latex and to make your life easier this template.
* Write one sentence per line in your editor.  While `synctex` is able to establish correspondence between the `.tex` document
  and the compiled PDF, it can only to so on the level of lines. If you rely on word wrapping in your editor and write entire
  paragraphs in a single line, you make the process of going from errors found in PDF back to the source unnecessarily hard.
  Writing only a single sentence per line also makes diffs more readable.
* Avoid errors early. Spellcheck your writing and put references where they belong.
* Keep your glossary up to date. Whenever you use and acronym add it to the `acronyms.txt` file.
* Use a citation manager. See `Managing Literature` for more information.
* Use [`booktabs`](https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf) style for your tables. Tables can be conveniently
  generated using [Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/latex_tables).
  The style should then be set to `Booktabs table style`.
* Get familiar with VSCode. https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tips-and-tricks is a good starting point.
* Use git and GitHub to manage your versions. Since `.tex` files are just text documents
  you can easily use git to manage your version and even sync them back to GitHub to back them up.

### Managing Literature

A citation manager is key to keep your literature references and citations manageable.
I personally prefer [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/).
If you have experience with it and want to stay open source you can also use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

#### Mendeley

Mendeley has a desktop app, but also a mobile app, which is very useful if you want to read papers on mobile device.

##### Importing Literature

Use the [Mendeley Web Importer](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/web-importer) to add papers to your library.
Once added you need to review the bibliographic metadata in the desktop app.

##### Reading papers

When reading a paper you should at least summarize it in three to four key points in the notes section.
Moreover, you should highlight important sections in the paper itself. 
You can use color coding to signify different purposes:

* yellow: important points
* red: terms you don't understand
* pink: references you want to add to your collection
* grey: references you wanted and have added your collection
